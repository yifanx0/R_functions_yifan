# Some Useful R Functions

This is a repo for some functions I have written in R, inspired when I was solving various problems. Right now, there is only one very simple functions in the repo. I will add more along the way.

## [df_diff](https://github.com/yifanx0/R_functions_yifan/blob/master/r_dt_diff.R): Comparing Data Tables and Locating Differences
